# waffle.io-due-dates

Chrome extension that adds "due date" recognition to waffle.io.

Simply add text to cards/issues like "`Due 9/1 - Do a thing`" or "`Issue name blah blah (due 10/12)`"

Cards with due dates in them have:

 - Get a special label indicating how far until they're due
 - If the card is due "soon" (defined as within 3 days) it gets highlighted with a clock icon.
 - Overdue cards get a warning icon
 - Column headers get a clock icon if there are any cards due soon within the column.
